# Find The Realtion Between Series A and Series B Values Using Any Machine Learning/ Deep Learning  
# Problem: For Every X value There is a definite Y value Being Generated, Here we Consider Series A  of values as X, and Series B Series of values are Y. So For If Series A value Is INTEGER(721457446580647751014191829380889690493307935711) and Corresponding Series Y Value Is Generated As INTEGER(1) ... and So On... in the DATAFILE.CSV, 
# Question : Predict The Following Corresponding Values of Series A if Series B values are : 50001 , 50002 , 50003 , 50004 , 50005
DatasetFile : TestBatch-50000.csv\
Note: If You Find the value Please Comment In Issues Section . Thanks
